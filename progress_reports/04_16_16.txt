After a lull in activity, team XRAY is back on the track. Recent studies in class have brought us to the core of this project: Convolutional Neural Nets. 
We realized that trainig these nets is no small task. It is very time intensive, and as the semester comes to a close we find ourselves short on time to train, time to work on the project, but not short on ideas. 

We've started out by implementing the tensorflow tutorial on convnets. Much of their code is helpful in showing us a starting point. We've utilized Amazon EC2 instances to build an AMI that can run tensorflow on GPUs and look forward to running even faster on 4 gpus after we finish our first model. As we speak, the model is being trained and looks on it's way towards 86% accuracy on test data. We can only speculate at this point however, and once the day is over we'll know for sure.

Our next steps involve reseach. We'll be looking into the best approach for our next iteration of a model and hopefully use our time wisely by implementing a great solution. Some things that look promising are Dr. Ben Graham's Spatially SParse Conv Nets, the code for which he's released online. The testing error from a 2014 cifar-10 compettiton was 4.47%, so we'll definitely look to learn from what he's done to improve our solution.
