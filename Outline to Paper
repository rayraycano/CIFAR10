Conclusion:


Your final approach (feature choice/model choice/training protocol) and your final standing in the competition.
METHODS

A discussion of how you selected/constructed features.
METHODS

A discussion of how you approached model assessment â€“ in particular, how you controlled for overfitting.
CONSIDERSATIONS/METHODS

A discussion of how you approached model selection.
CONSIDERATIONS

A summary table of all algorithm/algorithm combinations tried, together with their performance. This should be accompanied by a discussion of why the algorithms performed as they did for this problem.
METHODS

What did your experiments reveal about the prediction problem? The data set? The algorithms?
CONCLUSIONS

How did you select the approach for your final submission?
METHODS

What lessons did you learn about solving prediction problems using machine learning and large data sets?
CONCLUSION

A list of technical references consulted during the course of the competition.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS/REFERENCES

A list of URLs to software built by others that you used for your experiments.
ACKNOWLEDGEMETNS/REFERENCES

A plot showing your dates of submission on the x-axis and your classification accuracy on Kaggle on the y-axis
