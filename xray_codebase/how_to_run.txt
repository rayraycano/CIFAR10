Hey Guys!! 

here's our code base for the CIFAR-10 Project.

All code for non-convolutional neural nets is stored in /softmax and SVM.

To run a given svm model:

1) Move to_bin.py, test.py, and tf.sh into the model folder you want (Our best model was relu_1. Note: Not every folder has a model. Some models trained but failed to converge, and their models performed poorly so they were deleted. We figured we would include the code for these models anyways).

2) Run tf.sh (This makes sure all your packages are up to date)
3) Open up to_bin.py and type in the directory to your local test images
4) Run to_bin.py (This converts all our jpgs into properly formatted bin images)
5) Run test.py

The code skeleton for our convolutional Neural Nets was developed by Tensorflow.

The motivation for using Leaky Relus comes from the discussion of SparseConvNets on the Kaggle interview site

The resnet implementation follows from He, Kaiming et al. and the tensorflow resnet implementation comes from https://github.com/xuyuwei/resnet-tf.

The VGG net implemented is stems from the ImageNet classification VGG network: http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/very_deep/ with batch normalization cooked in as seen here: http://torch.ch/blog/2015/07/30/cifar.html
